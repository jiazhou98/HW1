# HW1 #
Homework for week 1. This is due Feburary 13th at 11:59pm.

# Set Up #
## Installing Python ##

We are going to be using Jupyter notebook to do homework. If you already know how to set everything up, feel free to do so. Otherwise follow these steps:
https://www.continuum.io/downloads - Follow the instructions here to download and install Anaconda, a platform agnostic package manager for python.

1. Launch the Anaconda prompt, and type jupyter notebook to launch Jupyter notebook on your computer. Alternatively launch the Anaconda navigator and click on Jupyter Notebook.
2. Download the homework, and find the homework file in Jupyter's file manager.
3. Open the homework and do it.
4. When you are done, click file -> save as .py file and send the file to your assigned CA :)


# Testing #
Please see the homework assignement.

# Grading #
We will run our own test suite against your code. This means that the tests are NOT comprehensive. There may be some edge cases where your code breaks. To avoid these issues, please read the questions carefully and discuss with your fellow classmates about edge cases. Typically we will NOT answer these questions on Piazza (however students are free to discuss them on piazza).

Homework's MUST be submitted by 11:59pm CST(+/-DST appropriately). Even if you're 1 microsecond late (that is you submit your homework 11:59pm+1e-6) we will grade the homework that was last submitted at 11:59pm.

We DO NOT accept excuses unless accompanied with a medical note or official documents. Please contact me (Shotaro Ikeda - <ikeda2@illinois.edu>) if there is any concern. In layman's terms, unless you have a REALLY good reason, I reverse the right to refuse any homework submissions. (Yes, that includes "I couldn't push my homework to Git", "My computer ate my dog", and "My Linux partition died on me because I ran an O(2^n) problem that you gave me, which caused a buffer overflow that proceeded to rewrite my Master Boot Record")

However, if you have sufficient evidence to believe there was any mistake you think happened when running the autograder, please let me know. ("But I passed all the tests you gave me!" does not count).

# Submission #
Please email the Course Staff that was assigned to you your homework solutions.

# Mistakes #
Please let someone in course staff (or email me at <ikeda2@illinois.edu>) as soon as possible. Describing the mistake you have found.

# Receiving Help #
Come to office hours, ask your friend, ask the internet, anything goes. However, if you do end up using an algorithm that you did not explicitly come up with, please cite it. Remember that the homework's are practice for you, the more time you spend on it, the better you'll get.

When asking for help from Course Staff, PLEASE do not show us code and ask us to debug it. Unless you have:
1. Commented EVERY SINGLE line explaining your line of thought (I took a list an iterated through it does not count)
2. [Grabbed the nearest available rubber duck that you ordered from Amazon Prime and explained your code to it.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)
3. Have a detailed outline of your thought process.

# Cheating #
We take cheating very seriously. If you get caught cheating, we will report it to the department and bad things happen. Just don't risk it, it's not worth it. We have a very lenient sourcing policy for this reason.
